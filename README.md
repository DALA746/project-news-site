# News Site

A classic newspaper site with a responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using media queries. I am interested in gaming that why I chose to create a gaming news site for all curious gaming fans! ðŸŽ®

# How did I do it and what I learned

I had some experience with Flexbox before so I chose to use Flexbox for my site. The page has three main sections: navigation bar, main news, and other news sections with cards plus a footer. It is three containers of Flexbox that contain other flexboxes.

With that project, I learned: 

- How to design in Figma
- How to structure my webpage using Box Model 
- How to build a responsive page with Flexbox, learned how media queries work. 
- Using sematic HTML tags and its benefits. 
- How to orginize my code to make it more readable
